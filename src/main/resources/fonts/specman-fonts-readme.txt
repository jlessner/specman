Specman provides 3 shipped fonts which are suitable for both UI and PDF export. As an important detail, the font family names of the fonts must not contain blanks as this would require single quoting in HTML style definitions to make iText's pdfHTML to correctly interpret the font family name. But quoted font family names are not correctly recognized by JEditorPane. The only way to satisfy both is to use font family names without blanks.
The font CourierPrime is the font "Courier Prime" from Google Fonts with the family name changed to "CourierPrime" using the online font meta data manipulation at https://products.aspose.app/font/metadata/ttf
